this is the RadioScatter module for GEANT4. It simulates RF scattering from ionization deposits left by particle showers produced in geant4. it is highly customizable, and lives inisde of GEANT4. the module slac_rf is g4 source code that will produce histograms of voltages received in a scattering experiment. to use it, you need to have GEANT4 and know how to use it (somewhat) and also have the RadioScatter.hh source file in a directory like:

/usr/include/radioscatter/RadioScatter.hh
or
/usr/local/include/radioscatter/Radioscatter.hh
